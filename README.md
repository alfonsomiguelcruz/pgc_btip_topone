# TopONE (Topological Omics for Non-tree Evolution)

This project that aims to understand how recombination events influence the topology structure and its quantities using topological data analysis (TDA). The project seeks to determine whether topology can detect recombination events. More specifically, this project asks the following questions :

1. Is topology robust to noise and sparse genomic samples?
2. Does recombination change the topology of genommic samples?

The project's repository makes use of scripts and sequence files to answer the questions above. This project was made during the 2024 Bioinformatics Training and Internship Program headed by the Philippine Genome Center.
